## How it works
![acos-statemachine](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96845776/152659924-388025b8-9dc9-4c1d-b152-e466b2352028.png)

1. Your client code sends `action`
2. Your server JS code runs on ACOS, reads `action`, and changes JSON `state`.
3. ACOS distributes JSON back to clients, to react on changes.
